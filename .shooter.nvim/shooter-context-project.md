## PROJECT SPECIFIC CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create unit tests and e2e tests for all new functionality. Tests should cover at least 20% of each test coverage metric (better more).
2. For bug fixes, first write or adapt a test that reproduces the bug, then fix the bug.
3. Implementation details go in plans/progress.txt, not in shot files.
4. Keep files under 200 lines of code (enforced project constraint).
5. Update README.md when adding commands, keybindings, or config options.
6. Update CLAUDE.md if architecture changes.
