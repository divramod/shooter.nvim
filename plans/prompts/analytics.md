# analytics

## shot 5
add git commit stats to analytics.
as you also created a nice bar chart for the shots i created, i want a similar bar chart for the number of commits i did

## shot 4
add lines of code stats per to analytics

i the project analytics, the base is for the bar chart is not the repo, here it is the shotfile.
there you should analyze, how many shots per shotfile exist and add the top 3 per day at the end

## x shot 2 (2026-01-26 07:04:52)
ad minimum one bar, when a shot was made at a day. the other logic stays.

in the global and local analytics, can you add a bar chart that shows me the number of shots per day for the last 30 days?
